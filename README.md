This current version has a full GUI, fully functional synth, three tone colors, and adjustable "depth" parameter.

The next version will include keystoke control of notes, and a "speed" parameter.  This parameter will controll the rate at which "depth" is oscillated within a set range (+/- 0.25*Depth oscillating about 0.5*Depth).  The "speed" will range from ~1Hz up to 50Hz.

Original starter code provided by JUCE.
First modification by Romain Michon.
